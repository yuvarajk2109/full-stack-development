// Kata C (LSP): FrozenHoldingBad.java (given, don't modify) extends Holding and
// breaks its contract by making adjust() always throw. Fix this WITHOUT
// inheriting from Holding at all - use composition instead (hold a Holding as a
// field). Expose only getQuantity(); there should be no adjust() method here,
// because a frozen holding genuinely can't be adjusted, and pretending otherwise
// (by exposing a method that always throws) is exactly the mistake
// FrozenHoldingBad makes.
