# Lab 13 — Reactive Forms: Building, Submitting & Handling Responses

## Setup

Your own `mission-ui` from Module 12, with the generated `OrderControllerService` and
`MissionApi` working. Same running backends as Module 11/12.

## Task

### Part 1: Build the reactive form

1. Import `ReactiveFormsModule` into `PlaceOrder`'s `imports` array.
2. Build a `FormGroup` with `FormBuilder` matching `OrderRequestDto`'s shape: `ticker`,
   `instrumentType`, `quantity`, `price`, `side`. Add `Validators.required` to every field,
   and `Validators.min(0.01)` to `quantity` and `price`.
3. Bind the template with `[formGroup]`/`formControlName`, and show a per-field error message
   when a control is `invalid && touched`.
4. On `(ngSubmit)`: if the form is invalid, call `markAllAsTouched()` and return; otherwise
   read `getRawValue()` and call `missionApi.submitOrder(...)`.

### Part 2: Surface the real server message

5. In `mission-api.ts`'s `catchError`, change the error handling to read `error.error?.message`
   (the real response body from Sprint 6's `GlobalExceptionHandler`) before falling back to
   `error.message`.

## Verify

1. **Client-side validation**: clear the quantity field, click elsewhere, confirm a
   `field-error` message appears without submitting anything.
2. **A real success**: fill in a valid `BUY` order and submit. Confirm the real `ACCEPTED`
   response with a fee and new holding quantity.
3. **A real business-rule rejection you trigger yourself**: submit a `SELL` order for far
   more shares than your test account actually holds (check your holdings first). Confirm the
   real message — something like `cannot sell more than the current holding` — not a generic
   `422` status line. If you still see a generic message, you haven't finished Part 2.
4. Query Postgres before and after your successful order, the same way Module 11/12 did —
   confirm the rejected `SELL` order changed **nothing** in the database.

## A Question Worth Sitting With

`Validators.min(0.01)` on `quantity` and a server-side check of `quantity <= 0` in
`OrderValidator` look almost identical. Given that, is the server-side check now redundant —
could it safely be deleted since the client "already" validates this? Argue for or against,
specifically referencing what Module 4's `novalidate` discussion already established about
client-side-only validation.

BOTH client side and server side validation are important. If the APIs are exposed, client side validation would be of no help. Server side validation is equally important as well.

A second question: today's fix read `error.error?.message` with an optional chain (`?.`),
not `error.error.message`. What real situation would make `error.error` itself `undefined` or
not have a `.message` property, and what would the UI show in that case with the code as
written?

It is based on how the message is returned in backend. If no message is returned, that property would not be there.
If no error body is returned, error.error would be undefined as well.
