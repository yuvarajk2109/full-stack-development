# Module 5 Lab — The Full Stack So Far & Where Angular Fits

## Objectives

By the end of this lab you will have:

- Traced a single request end to end through every layer of the mission stack, including
  the Angular app that doesn't exist yet
- Identified exactly which existing piece each future Angular module will build, and
  which parts of Modules 1-4's hand-written HTML/CSS/JS each one replaces

## Format

A 20-minute team whiteboard exercise. No code, no repo changes — a diagram (on paper, a
whiteboard, or a shared doc) is the deliverable.

## The Scenario

A trader opens `mission-ui` (the Angular app you'll spend the rest of this sprint
building), logs in, and submits an order. Modules 1-4 already built a rough version of
"logging in" by hand — a static HTML form, some CSS, and a `fetch()` call to
`sprint8-auth-service`. Today's demo proved every box past that point (the mission
service, Postgres) already works too, for real, against a real Postgres row.

## Task

With your team, sketch the request flow for two scenarios, this time with Angular as the
first box in the picture, not `curl`.

### Scenario A — Logging in through the UI

1. What does the trader type into the Angular app, and what does Angular send to
   `sprint8-auth-service`, and with what?

- `The trader simply fills in his username and password.`
- `Angular sends this data as a JSON body, along with the JWT - basically the required specs/parameters for the API to work`

2. What comes back, and where in the Angular app does it get stored so later requests can
   use it?

- `Access token and refresh token come back.`
- `Access token is stored in localStorage.`
- `Refresh token is stored in session.`

3. What should the UI show the trader while that request is in flight, and if it fails?

- `Show a spinner!`
- `If it fails - 401 Unauthorized`

### Scenario B — Submitting an order through the UI

1. What does the trader fill in on screen, and what does Angular send to the mission
   service's `/accounts/{id}/orders` — and how does the token from Scenario A get attached?

- `The required body for placing an order`
- `JWT attached to header`

2. Which box checks the token's signature? Which box never sees the password, and which
   box never sees the raw SQL?

- `Trade API checks token's signature.`
- `Trade API never sees password.`
- `Trade API controller never sees raw SQL.`

3. If the mission service returns `401` or `403`, what should the Angular app show the
   trader — and is "the API returned an error" ever an acceptable message to put on
   screen?

- `401 - Unauthorized - JWT expired/invalid.`
- `403 - Forbidden - RBAC`

4. If the order succeeds, what changed in Postgres, and how does the trader find out
   their portfolio actually updated?

- `Holding gets a new row`
- `Trader can check their portfolio data for the updated value.`

## Deliverable

A diagram with five boxes — Angular app, `sprint8-auth-service`, mission service,
Postgres, and the trader's browser session/token storage — arrows labelled with what's
actually sent at each hop, covering both scenarios. Next to each box, write which Sprint
9 module builds it (or "already built, Sprint N" for the three that aren't new).

## Acceptance criteria

- The diagram correctly shows Angular calling the auth service ONCE (login) and the
  mission service repeatedly (every subsequent request), not the other way round
- Every arrow into the mission service or auth service carries the token where the real
  demo's `curl` command did — no arrow "forgets" the `Authorization` header
- At least one failure state (invalid token, validation error, network failure) is shown
  with a specific, trader-facing UI response, not just "show an error"
- Each of the five boxes is labelled with the Sprint 9 module (or prior sprint) that owns
  it
