// KATA: refactor Module 2's login-attempts.js into this module's style.
// Three TODOs. Run this now, before changing anything - it throws at
// TODO 1. That's the starting point.
//
// Reference Module 2's ORIGINAL, working script if you get stuck:
// labs/02-javascript-fundamentals-syntax-variables-functions-and-control-flow/login-attempts.js
// (do not copy its string-splitting approach - that's exactly what this
// refactor replaces)

import { morningAttempts, afternoonAttempts } from "./attempts-data.mjs";

// TODO 1: combine morningAttempts and afternoonAttempts into one array
// called allAttempts, using the spread operator (no loop, no .concat()).
const allAttempts = [...morningAttempts, ...afternoonAttempts];

// TODO 2: write describeOutcome as an ARROW FUNCTION that takes a single
// attempt object, destructures { username, outcome } in its parameter
// list, and returns "<username> logged in successfully" or
// "<username> failed to log in" using an if/else (not a ternary).

// TODO 3: write isLockedOut(attempts, username) - same consecutive-failure
// check as Module 2's while loop, but you can write it with whichever loop
// you prefer now that you understand what it needs to do. Then write
// checkLockouts(attempts, ...usernames) using a REST parameter, returning
// the array of usernames that are locked out, and call it below with
// "dave", "erin", and "frank".
const isLockedOut = (attempts, username) => {
