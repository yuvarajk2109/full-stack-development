# Module 13 Demo Guide — JWT Essentials: Issuing & Validating Tokens

Module 11's skeleton flagged two gaps. Module 12 closed the first (plain-text
passwords). This module closes the second: `issueStubToken` returning a random
string is replaced with `jwt.sign` issuing a real, signed JSON Web Token — the exact
mechanism Sprint 6's real `auth-stub` already uses.

## Part 1: What a JWT Actually Is

```bash
node jwt-basics-demo.mjs
```

Issue one, using the EXACT `jwt.sign` call Sprint 6's `auth-stub` uses:

```javascript
const token = jwt.sign(
  { sub: "alice", roles: ["MISSION_OPERATOR"] },
  SECRET,
  { algorithm: "HS256", expiresIn: "1h" },
);
```

Verified real output (a real token, truncated here for space):

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhbGljZSIs...
```

**A JWT is three base64url-encoded parts, separated by dots** — header, payload,
signature. Split it apart and decode the first two directly:

```javascript
const [header, payload, signature] = token.split(".");
Buffer.from(header, "base64url").toString();
```

Verified real output:

```
decoded header:  {"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}
decoded payload: {"sub":"alice","roles":["MISSION_OPERATOR"],"iat":1784227871,"exp":1784231471}
```

**This is worth stating plainly, because it surprises people: a JWT is encoded, not
encrypted.** Anyone holding a token — including a browser's dev tools, or `curl`, or
this demo script — can read `sub` and `roles` directly, no secret required. The
SECRET only protects the SIGNATURE, not the contents. Never put anything in a JWT
payload that the token's holder shouldn't be able to read.

## Part 2: Verifying — What the Signature Actually Buys You

```javascript
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, SECRET);
```

Verified real output:

```
{ sub: 'alice', roles: [ 'MISSION_OPERATOR' ], iat: 1784227871, exp: 1784231471 }
```

Now three ways a REAL verification genuinely fails:

**Tampering with the payload** (adding an `"ADMIN"` role, re-encoding, keeping the
original signature):

```
JsonWebTokenError: invalid signature
```

The signature is computed over the header AND payload together — change either one
by a single byte and the signature no longer matches. This is the entire point of
signing: the payload is READABLE but not WRITABLE without the secret.

**Verifying with the wrong secret:**

```
JsonWebTokenError: invalid signature
```

Same error — from the verifier's point of view, a tampered token and a token signed
with a different secret look identical: "the signature doesn't match what I'd
compute."

**An already-expired token:**

```
TokenExpiredError: jwt expired
```

A different, more specific error — `exp` is checked separately from the signature,
so `jwt.verify` can tell you WHICH thing failed.

## Part 3: Real Tokens, Wired Into the Auth Service

```typescript
private issueAccessToken(username: string, roles: string[]): string {
  return jwt.sign({ sub: username, roles }, JWT_SECRET, {
    algorithm: "HS256",
    expiresIn: "15m",
  });
}
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"alice","password":"mission123"}'
```

Verified real output (`accessToken` decodes to a real `{ sub, roles, iat, exp }`
payload — try it, exactly like Part 1):

```
{"accessToken":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...","refreshToken":"7285624e75..."}
```

**One deliberate asymmetry, worth naming:** `accessToken` is now a real JWT;
`refreshToken` stays an OPAQUE random string, not a JWT. This is a common,
deliberate real-world pattern, not an oversight — an access token is self-contained
and short-lived (`expiresIn: "15m"` here); a refresh token is long-lived and only
useful in combination with SERVER-SIDE state (the `users` map), which is exactly
what lets Module 11's `logout` revoke it. A signed JWT alone can't be revoked before
its own expiry — there's no server-side state to delete.

## Why JWT_SECRET Has to Match Exactly

```typescript
const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET ||
  "mission-control-shared-secret-key-32-bytes-minimum";
```

Read directly from Sprint 6's real `auth-stub/server.js` — same variable name, same
fallback string. This is what makes Sprint 6's mission service (Java, validating
tokens with the SAME secret) able to accept tokens issued by THIS service, unchanged
— the whole reason Module 11 called this the "eventual replacement."

## A Running Comparison

| Node/jsonwebtoken | Java |
|---|---|
| `jwt.sign(payload, secret, { algorithm, expiresIn })` | `Jwts.builder().claim(...).signWith(...).compact()` (jjwt) |
| `jwt.verify(token, secret)` | `Jwts.parser().verifyWith(...).build().parseSignedClaims(token)` |
| `JsonWebTokenError` | `SignatureException` / `MalformedJwtException` |
| `TokenExpiredError` | `ExpiredJwtException` |

## Transition to the Lab

Learners add a SHORT expiry and a real expiry check to a JWT-issuing function of
their own, following this demo's exact `jwt.sign`/`jwt.verify` pattern — verified by
issuing a token, waiting past its expiry, and confirming `jwt.verify` throws the
right named error.
