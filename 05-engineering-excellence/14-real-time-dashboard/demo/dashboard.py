"""
Sprint 7 Mission Build - the Sprint 4 dashboard, extended.

Sprint 4's dashboard.py had one extract() reading a local CSV. This version
has TWO extract functions - one per data-movement pattern this sprint spent
14 modules teaching - merged into one combined view, exactly as the mission
brief promised: "two different data-movement patterns, feeding one
dashboard, each used where it's actually the right tool."

  extract_batch()  - settled_trades, the Postgres warehouse table Module 7's
                      idempotent loader populated. End-of-day, complete,
                      slow-moving. This is TODAY's settlement position.

  extract_stream()  - trade-events, the Kafka topic Module 9's OrderService
                      publishes to. Whatever has happened in roughly the
                      last few minutes. Fast-moving, may be incomplete.

Only the extract layer changed. transform(), compute_insights(), and
print_dashboard() don't care where a row came from - only that every row
has the same shape (ticker, account_id, quantity, source).

    The real-time side: read whatever trade events are currently on the

    A fresh, random group.id every run is DELIBERATE, not an oversight -
    Module 5 taught group.id as "what has this consumer already seen."
    A dashboard snapshot tool isn't a persistent processor tracking its own
    progress; every run wants the FULL recent picture, not "only what's
    arrived since I last checked." A real production version of this would
    likely read from a bounded time window instead of from the beginning -
